<h2>FoSS@Amritagiri</h2>
<p>FOSS@Amritagiri is the open source club.It is a volunteer driven club that focuses on free and open source software (FOSS), 
  open standards, open technologies, and open content. The goal of this society is to promote awareness, usage, and development of FOSS.</p>
<h2>What is FOSS?</h2>
<p>FOSS is a matter of the User’s freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. The “free” as is used in Free and Open Source 
  Softwares refers to ‘free as in freedom’ rather cost. More precisely it refers to four kinds of freedom to the user’s of the Software
  The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.</p>
 <h2>Why FOSS?</h2>
 <p>Free and open source software is becoming increasingly important in the technology industry. Open source tools drive innovation in the industry today. In fact, the Internet, the leading compilers, databases, security protocols, etc. are all based on open source technologies and open collaboration.

    Given the extensive use of open source technologies in the industry, students and professionals skilled in open source are high in demand.
    
    One of the best things about being involved in open source is that your work does not stay locked in a particular organization. As you move from one organization to another,
     your work remains with the open source community and you. Since your work is released under an open source license, the legal framework around the license ensures that your work 
     is always accessible to you and others who may benefit from your work. The fact that potential users, collaborators, and employers can reach your work easily and unencumbered earns you street cred in the technology community.</p>
